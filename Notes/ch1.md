## Measuring Performance 

### CPU Execution Time 
- $ \text{CPU Time} = \text{CPU Clock Cycles} / \text{Clock Rate}$
- $ \text{Clock Rate} = \text{Cycles} / \text{Seconds}$
    

### Power Equation 
- $\text{Power (Watts)} = \text{Capacitive Load} \times \text{Frequency Switched} \times \text{Voltage}^2$ 


### Amdahl's Law 
- performance enhancement is tied to only the processes responsible for performance 
    - i.e: you can't improve an overall process w/o improving the sub-processes

## MIPS 

### Million Instructions Per Second
- $\text{MIPS} = \text{Instruction Count} / (\text{Execution Time} \times 10^6)$
- $\text{CPI} = \text{Clock Cycles per. Instruction}$
- **NOTE:**
    - GHz is just Clock Rate $\times 10^6$
